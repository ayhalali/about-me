I am a graduate student working on my MS in Applied Computer Science. This is my first semester as a graduate student in NW.

Working with computers is an interesting thing for me and thatâ€™s why I got an associated degree in Computer Networking. I have experience as a bookstore manager in Saudi Arabia, where I grew up, which is one of the biggest bookstores in the Middle East. I worked there from 2003 till 2014 and then decided to get out of my comfort zone and go back to school to improve myself and get a higher position. I came here in NW in 2014 and got my BS degree in Management Information Systems and now pursuing my master degree in ACS.

My plan after graduating is to go back to the work. Since I have experience in management and I loved my previous position and love working with computers as well, I hope to get a position where I can lead a team in a computer department.
